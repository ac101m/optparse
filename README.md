# optparse
A simple C++ command line option parser that conforms to my specific sensibilities.

# Build instructions
You will need:
- GNU make
- A working installation of GCC (you'll need to modify the makefile to use another compiler)
- A Linux OS, you probably _may_ be able to build it under windows using MinGW, but I haven't tried. Best of luck to you.

Just navigate to the root of the source tree and run `make lib_static` your libraries and headers will appear in bin/install.
